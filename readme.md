# :new: features

Instead of the raw Java Servlet, I'm moving to Spring and a mobile-friendly UI w just 3 buttons:

+	**Browse :camera:**
	+	Browses the camera roll & files
+ 	**Adjsct :mag:**
	+	:arrow_up_down: to set the zoom factor for the selected image
	+	:left_right_arrow: to set the zoom factor for the cover/profile-picture
+	**Save :floppy_disk:**
	+	Browser redirects to the Data URI or downloads it on Chrome

# TODO:
:pushpin: Upload to facebook button
:pushpin: try doing the same for sites, may be?


### The **old site** was moved to the branch [v1](https://github.com/yoga1290/SubCover/tree/v1)
